        <div class="box">
            <p>Research Scientist I at Cargill for ten years; recently affected by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/cargill-layoffs-thousands-job-cuts-27b8882b53fd1c026d17e0570ea49d4b">global layoffs</a>, allowing me to follow my passion for web development.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <p>Gained skills that are applicable to web development - please see "Skills" section below.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <p>On-the-job coding experience: During the last two years (2023-24) I carved out roughly 20% of my work responsibilities for coding. I taught myself to make nearly a dozen tools using Visual Basic for Applications in Excel, to my coworkers' specifications, to improve their efficiency. My list of <a href="">references</a> indicates coworkers who are familiar with my coding work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <p>During the month since I left Cargill on 12/6/24, I've achievd a lot:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>learned PHP, and added a contact form to my <a href="">portfolio site</a>;</li>
                <li>created my <a href="">CSS Sandbox</a> page;</li>
                <li>made <a href="">a copy</a> of the CreativeNavigation.com home page from scratch, complete with functional contact form;</li>
                <li>made this sweet resume, plus <a>references</a> page (both fully responsive and mobile-first, by the way).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I hope that gives you a positive impression of my dedication and capability in this space. Receipts are available on <a href="https://github.com/WeatherheadOnline">my Github account</a>.</p>

                <h4>Methodical troubleshooting / problem solving mindset</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>Inevitably, while performing high-throughput lab testing, I would sometimes get a result that didn't make sense in context. I learned to look for patterns in the data that could implicate the steps at which errors could have occurred and the equipment that might have malfunctioned, and to then run through the corresponding potential fixes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>I've carried this mindset over into coding. I methodically use tools to troublshoot, including browser dev tools to investigate element placement, and, when needed, online searches because consulting others is more efficient than re-inventing the wheel.</p>

                <h4>Attention to detail, combined with solid mental overview of concurrent projects</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>Details are impactful. In the lab, I honed my sharp attention to detail while being mindful of multiple details at each of the steps in the workflow: remember to add chemical X, but only if I'm working with species Y, and only if using variant Z of the method; if the robot's liquid levels are off at point A in the process, check the output for effect B; etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>Concurrently, I learned to be aware of overarching projects' needs. If priorities for a project shifted, I was able to mentally pivot on the fly, re-schedule various tasks for multiple projects to maintain respective timelines, and reach out to colleagues where needed to ensure all tasks were performed on time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>I've found that experience invaluable in web development. Attention to detail has helped me create responsive and visually pleasing layouts. At the same time, having a mental model of an overall project has been instrumental in efficiently isolating which lines of code to alter.</p>

                <h4>Excellent communication skills: concise, keeping in mind what others need to know and antipating what questions they might need answered</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>Over time I've noticed coworkers asking me the same questions in the same contexts. It's helped me to further develop my theory of mind. I now habitually ask myself: what might this person need to know, how can I present the information in a way that makes sense to them as they hear about it for the first time, and what follow-up questions might I have if I was in their position? I also do my best to actively listen, address any apparent concerns, and focus on sharing relevant information.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>These are communication skills that translate to any workplace. If you ask any of my <a href="">references</a>, I'm confident they'll describe me as easy and fun to work with, and that they'll verify my ability to communicate effectively.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p>In the past, I let impatience and enthusiasm get the better of me and didn't want to "waste" time planning before getting to the "actual" work. However, as <a href="">my manager</a> will tell you, I have made huge progress over the years. I understand now that I've learned the hard way: a little planning at the outset can save time spent on unnecessary tasks or irrelevant side quests.</p>
